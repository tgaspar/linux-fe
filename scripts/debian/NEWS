cowsay (3.03+dfsg2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since cowsay 3.03+dfsg1-13, cowsay is now split into two packages:
  cowsay and cowsay-off. cowsay contains the binaries as well as the
  main cows. cowsay-off package contains the cows which some people
  may consider to be offensive.

  If you have installed cowsay a while ago, you may be relying on cows
  which have been moved to cowsay-off. If that's the case, you'll need
  to install that package to continue using them.
