# FE ROS by Robolab

The Laboratory of Robotics (RoboLab, https://www.robolab.si/) organizes a workshop dedicated to learning the basics of the Linux and its command line. The workshop is heavily focused on practical knowledge and exercises. The page you're seeing was created to be an aid to the in-person workshop. Here you will find explanations, outside sources, code snippets and more.

This documentation website was created by the presenters and organizers of the workshop.
