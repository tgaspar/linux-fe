## Executing processes in the background

Until now we executed every command or script in a way that the result was immediately visible. That is also because most of the commands and processes did not take much time. In this part of the workshop we will learn how to manage processes in the foreground and background. We will also learn how to stop a process running in the background and monitor a process' resource usage.

In this part of the workshop we will be starting up programs that have a graphical user interface (GUI). That is because those programs are running for a longer time.
