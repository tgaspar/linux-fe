## Why would I want to learn this?

This course is focused on giving the basic knowledge of Linux to students of robotics. Throughout the course we will not learn any commands that could be labeled as "robot-specific". However, due to the ever-growing importance of ROS in the robotics community, we find it necessary that students that study robotics also learn the basics of the operating system that ROS is *most* used on.
