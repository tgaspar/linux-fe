## What is Linux

## Why would I want to learn this?

## What is Bash?

From [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/master-the-bash-shell/3j8399P3M6M):
> Bash is a shell program.
> A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you type and (once you hit return),translates those commands into (ultimately) system calls to the Operating System API.

If you want to know what Bash can do simply ask:
```
user@ubuntu:~# help
```

That was not useful, was it? :) That is why we are going to have this workshop today.
